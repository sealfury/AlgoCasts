SPIRAL MATRIX SOLTION 1

* Create empy array of arrays called 'results'
* Create a counter variable, starting at 1
* As long as (start column <= end column) AND (start row <= end row):
    - Loop from start column to end column
        -At results[start_row][i] assign counter variable
        -Increment counter
    - Increment start row
    - Loop from start row to end row
        -At results[i][end_column] assign counter variable
        -Increment counter
    - Decrement end column
    - ...Repeat for other two sides
