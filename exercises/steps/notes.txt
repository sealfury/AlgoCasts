function printNumber(n) {
  // base case
  if (n === 0) {
    return
  }

  // do some work then call fn again
  console.log(n)

  // call function again
  // it is extremely important that we have changed the args in some fashion
  printNumber(n - 1)

printNumber(10)

*RECURSION TIPS*
1. Figure out the bare minimum pieces of information to represent your problem

2. Give reasonable defaults to the bare minimum pieces of info

3. Check the base case. Is there any work left to do? If not, return

4. Do some work. Call your function again, making sure the arguments have changed in some fashion.
